<h3>About the author</h3>
<p style=font-size:18px> I am currently a research fellow in Unmanned System Research Group in NUS ECE department. I obtained my bachelor degree in engineering in Zhejiang University with a specialty of automation in 2011 and obtained Doctor of Philosophy at National University of Singapore in 2015. My main research focus was in unmanned aerial vehicle guidance, navigation and control, embedded system development, circuit design and fucntion debugging, real-time operating system, embedded Linux and QNX, motor control techniques. I continued with my research as a research fellow in the USR group, with more focus on sensor driver development, data processing as well as algorithm implementation in UAV system. </p>

<h3>About the Unmanned System Research Group</h3>
<p style=font-size:18px> The Unmanned System Research Group at the National University of Singapore has been working on various research topics related to defense technologies since 2003. The main focus is on unmanned rotor-craft systems and unconventional aircraft, and to explore the potentials of the next generation intelligent UAVs in various applications. Extensive research efforts are dedicated to cope with challenges, in which a board range of disciplines are involved, including control theory, communications, aerodynamics, navigation, computer vision, multi-agent systems, hybrid systems and artificial intelligence. The current research focus is on topics related to navigation systems for indoor and foliage environments, vision-based navigation and motion coordination, micro aerial vehicles, unconventional aircraft and unmanned maritime robotics.

The research group has participated in various international competitions. In 2012, team GremLion was selected as one of the 9 finalists (out of 144 teams from 153 countries) to the final fly-off at the DARPA UAVForge Challenge, held in Fort Stewart, Georgia, USA. In the 2013 International UAV Innovation Grand Prix, held in Beijing, the NUS unconventional aircraft team was awarded a New Innovation Star Award and the rotorcraft team finished a 2nd place in the Rotary-Wing Competition (1st in the final round), for which its technical innovation was awarded the Guan Zhao-Zhi Award at the 33rd Chinese Control Conference held in Nanjing, China, 2014. NUS UAV team claimed the championship at the 2014 International Micro Air Vehicle Competition, held in Delft, the Netherlands. In 2015, the team secured the 2nd place in the outdoor IMAV competition, held in Aachen, Germany. In the same year, team AeroLion won the Championship of the Rotary-Wing Competition, taking the AVIC Cup at the 3rd International UAV Innovation Grand Prix held in Anji, Zhejiang. The team also swept constantly major awards in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competitions which were organized by DSO National Laboratories and supported by Ministry of Defence (MINDEF). </p>
